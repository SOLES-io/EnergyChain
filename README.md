# EnergyChain

A blockchain platform to tokenize and track energy-grid-attached appliance production, usage, availablity, share ownership, dividend and profit-sharing payouts, and renewable resource credits generation.

SOLES EnergyChain Project is a collaborative cross-industry effort to stand up a platform for the automated tracking of energy production, usage, availablity, share ownership, dividend and profit-sharing payouts from grid-attached devices and appliances, including tracking generation and retirement of renewable resource credits (RRCs) and device audit/registrations. EnergyChain is meant as a platform for energy projects from the "microgrid" to the municipal and regional level, solar / renewable installation and auditing organizations, and government organizations to all collaborate to use blockchains to achieve positive environmental impact and efficient energy distribution. SOLES is also building real-time markets for true pricing of energy and renewable resource credits tokenized into blockchains in the EnergyChain Project.
